Full statespace search for:
	never claim         	- (none specified)
	assertion violations	+
	acceptance   cycles 	- (not selected)
	invalid end states	+

State-vector 60 byte, depth reached 46, errors: 0
       45 states, stored
      146 states, matched
      191 transitions (= stored+matched)
       48 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         0 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.004	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.279	actual memory usage for states
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    5.341	memory used for DFS stack (-m100000)
  133.536	total actual memory usage
