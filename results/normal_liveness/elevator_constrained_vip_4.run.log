State-vector 60 byte, depth reached 96, errors: 0
       83 states, stored
      424 states, matched
      507 transitions (= stored+matched)
     1351 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         0 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.007	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.279	actual memory usage for states
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    5.341	memory used for DFS stack (-m100000)
