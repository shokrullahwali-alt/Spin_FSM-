// Minimal properties for MVP (2-floor)
// SAFETY properties are checked via inline assertions in the model.
// The model contains: assert(!(moving && door == OPEN));
// 
// For liveness properties, use LTL formulas below:

// Emergency: FIRE mode eventually leads to ground floor with door open and not moving
// [] (mode == FIRE -> <> (floor == 0 && door == OPEN && !moving))
